      <p><h3><b> Motivation </b></h3></p>

      <p> The motivation for my final project came from a YouTube video by Liam Thompson, linked <a href="https://youtu.be/Yg3SWcxMeF4">here</a>. In the video, he builds an elevator for his cat, Frodo, who was 19 years old at the time and had difficulty getting around the house. At the time of writing this, Frodo has unfortunately passed away. After hearing the news, I realized that I had grown attached to Frodo- a cat across the world that I had never even seen in-person- but his passing mid-way through the semester was a major motivator for me to take on the project in earnest. Apart from older animals, there are also pets with disabilites. And some breeds, in particular the dachshund and the chihuahua, have body morphologies that are not suited for climbing the stairs. Additionally, puppies and kittens may have difficulty due to their size and unsteadiness on their paws. I also wanted to take on the engineering challenge of trying to make the elevator adjustable both in terms of length and angle relative to the ground. </p>

      <p><h3><b> Project Documentation </b></h3></p>

      <p> Planning the build was arguably the hardest part of the process. I invested a lot of time into thinking about potential solutions to the issues of length and angle correction of the carriage. For example, what would be the best (feasible) way to make the frame itself extendable? Since extending the frame also means adjusting the length of the timing belt, how could I do that most effectively? And if the length of the elevator frame can vary, how could I program the stepper motor to stop at the top and bottom of the stairs given that counting steps was not an option? How could I adjust the the carriage so that it was parallel to the ground regardless of the angle of the elevator? </p>

      <p> I first started with something fairly straighforward. That is, the carriage itself. I knew the way I wanted it to look and it was not difficult to sketch in Fusion 360. I also converted a .png file I found online into a .svg file and imported it into the sketch- this became the dog and cat on the side of the carriage. I laser cut these parts from cardboard and used hot glue and tape to assemble them.  </p>

      <p> Then, I diverted my attention to the problem of adjusting the angle of the carriage. In hindsight, there were several potential candidate mechanisms but I am happy with the one I thought of and successfully implemented. The mechanism I arrived at was fairly simple- 5 pieces of cardboard (including the two small nubs attached directly underneath the carriage). The main piece was made by sketching a circle in Fusion 360 and leaving only a 100° slice of the pie. In this piece, I added small holes at 10° increments, such that the carriage can (theoretically) still be angled parallel to the ground when the elevator is perpendicular to it. This piece was connected to a "baseplate" of sorts using hot glue. The baseplate, in turn, was connected at the back to one side of the carriage using masking tape to form a makeshift hinge. A rod goes through the piece with a hole in it attached to the bottom of the carriage and the hole in the 100° piece to hold the carriage parallel to the ground. Here are is video footage and a picture of the carriage and angle adjustment mechanism. </p>

      <p> The next issue that I addressed was how to make the frame of the elevator extendable. This was actually surprisingly straightforward. I realized that two adjustable curtain rods joined together could serve as an extendable frame and headed off to Home Depot to purchase two <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/48-in-84-in-Single-Curtain-Rod-in-White-869473/309976499 ">48" to 84" adjustable curtain rods</a>. I also bought 1 square yard of carpet which I later used to decorate the inside of the carriage and the carboard supports (more on those later) as well as two metal hinges for the supports (which I ended up not using). </p>

      <p> I laser cut two small, rectangular pieces of wood and used these to connect the curtain rods at either end. To make sure the frame would not come apart at these two junctions, I used pliers to pinch/crimp the metal curtain rods around the wood pieces. I also added a dollop of hot glue just to be on the safe side. </p>

      <p> I knew that the NEMA-17 stepper motor I was going to use to drive the timing belt would be placed on the ground, and that I would need a free-spinning pulley at the opposite end to create a loop for the timing belt. However, I found that the 10mm wide timing belt I had with me did not fit into the 6mm-wide pulleys in the lab. I looked around and miraculously found two plastic gears that fit the ridges in the GT2 timing belt perfectly. These, of course, were thin gears without supports like the pulley to keep the timing belt on, and I later hot glued scrap pieces from the project just to try and keep the belt from slipping off. </p>

      <p> I found bearings in the lab that fit perfectly inside the curtain rods as pictured below and a wooden dowel that was the exact right fit for the inside of the bearing. I also tried metal rods, but none of them fit unfortunately. I hot glued a bearing onto one end of the dowel and then placed the gear. Since the center hole of the gears were slightly larger than both the dowel and shaft of the stepper motor, I had to wrap tape around both until I got a snug fit. After hot gluing the gears onto the dowel and the shaft of the stepper motor for good measure, I hot glued the last bearing onto the end of the wooden dowel (which I had pre-cut to fit snugly between the curtain rods). It was a really tight fit and I had to spend a considerable amount of time trying to shimmy the bearing-gear-bearing-dowel up to one of the frame. I eventually succeeded in doing so. </p>

      <p> I originally intended to attach the curtain rods using a block of wood on either end. I was thinking of attaching hinges to these wood blocks so that I could attach two other wooden pieces that could support the frame and prevent it from sliding out under its own weight. However, I had used the small lasercut pieces instead to join the frame and decided against drilling into the curtain rods to attach heavy supports directly. So, instead, I used cardboard pieces and masking tape. Similar to how I used masking tape to create a makeshift hinge connecting the carriage to the angle adjustment mechanism, I used masking tape here to connect the carboard "supports" to the frame, as pictured below. One of the other reasons I decided to go with cardboard was that I wanted to use pressure sensors that ideally would be concealed under the supports, and using heavy wood instead of cardboard may have made it difficult because of how sensitive the senosrs are (more on these to come). </p>

      <p> Next, I focused on how to make the length of the timing belt adjustable. I thought of many ideas and experimented with them, for example just using a small binder clip, but ultimately decided to go with a 3D-printed part that held onto the timing belt at either end of the loop very tightly. I designed this part in Fusion 360 by following a tutorial on YouTube describing <a href="https://youtu.be/_PyS34djcyw">how to model a simple timing belt in Fusion 360</a> and referencing <a href="https://www.robotics.org.za/image/catalog/generic/GT2-6MM/GT2-6MM%20-%20Layout02.jpg">this image</a>. I did not follow the tutorial in its entirety (because I was not looking to model a closed-loop timing belt) but used it as a starting point and borrowed some ideas that proved to be very helpful. I had to 3D print this part three times in total because the first time, the gaps between levels were too narrow for the timing belt to fit and they were not wide enough. The second time, I got a satifactory result but realized that it would be significantly easier if I removed one component so that the belt from either side of the loop could slot into the part. And the thirdd time was the charm for sure! (I later tried to recycle these "failed attempts" to keep the timing belt from slipping off the gear although that turned out not to be very effective.) Also, this seemingly small part is the one thing I am most happy about from this build. </p>

      <p> The frame with the timing belt and the carriage with the angle adjustment mechanism were separate at this point in the build and I wanted to bring them together. I ultimately decided to use clothespins to do this. I hot glued the clothespins to the bottom of the baseplate of the angle adjustment mechanism such that they could all latch onto the timing belt and secure the carriage in place. This worked surprisingly well and I was happy with the results, because it was difficult to decide what angles each pin should be at and which direction they should face. </p>

      <p> At this point, I made the pressure sensors by sandwiching a layer of velostat between two copper foil rectangles, taking care that the copper rectangles were not touching. I stuck leads onto the sticky side of the copper foil rectangles and spent two hours trying to figure out why the serial monitor was not giving consistent results. I later realized that the sticky side of the copper rectangles are non-conductive. Once I switched the side of the copper stickers the leads were placed, I got really consistent results and gained an appreciation for just how sensitive they were to changes in pressure. </p>
