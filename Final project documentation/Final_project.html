      <p><h3><b> Motivation </b></h3></p>

      <p> The motivation for my final project came from a YouTube video by Liam Thompson, linked <a href="https://youtu.be/Yg3SWcxMeF4">here</a>. In the video, he builds an elevator for his cat, Frodo, who was 19 years old at the time and had difficulty getting around the house. At the time of writing this, Frodo has unfortunately passed away. After hearing the news, I realized that I had grown attached to Frodo- a cat across the world that I had never even seen in-person- but his passing mid-way through the semester was a major motivator for me to take on the project in earnest. Apart from older animals, there are also pets with disabilites. And some breeds, in particular the dachshund and the chihuahua, have body morphologies that are not suited for climbing the stairs. Additionally, puppies and kittens may have difficulty due to their size and unsteadiness on their paws. I also wanted to take on the engineering challenge of trying to make the elevator adjustable both in terms of length and angle relative to the ground. </p>

      <p><h3><b> Project Documentation </b></h3></p>

      <p> Planning the build was arguably the hardest part of the process. I invested a lot of time into thinking about potential solutions to the issues of length and angle correction of the carriage. For example, what would be the best (feasible) way to make the frame itself extendable? Since extending the frame also means adjusting the length of the timing belt, how could I do that most effectively? And if the length of the elevator frame can vary, how could I program the stepper motor to stop at the top and bottom of the stairs given that counting steps was not an option? How could I adjust the the carriage so that it was parallel to the ground regardless of the angle of the elevator? </p>

      <p> I first started with something fairly straighforward. That is, the carriage itself. I knew the way I wanted it to look and it was not difficult to sketch in Fusion 360. I also converted a .png file I found online into a .svg file and imported it into the sketch- this became the dog and cat on the side of the carriage. I laser cut these parts from cardboard and used hot glue and tape to assemble them.  </p>

      <p> Then, I diverted my attention to the problem of angling the carriage. In hindsight, there were several potential candidate mechanisms but I am happy with the one I thought of and successfully implemented. The angling mechanism I arrived at was fairly simple- 5 pieces of cardboard (including the two small nubs attached directly underneath the carriage). The main piece was made by sketching a circle in Fusion 360 and leaving only a 100° slice of the pie. In this piece, I added small holes at 10° increments, such that the carriage can (theoretically) still be angled parallel to the ground when the elevator is perpendicular to it. This piece was connected to a "baseplate" of sorts using hot glue. The baseplate, in turn, was connected at the back to one side of the carriage using masking tape to form a makeshift hinge. A rod goes through the piece with a hole in it attached to the bottom of the carriage and the hole in the 100° piece to hold the carriage parallel to the ground. Here are is video footage and a picture of the carriage and angling mechanism. </p>

      </div> 

      <p> The next issue that needed to be addressed was how I was going to make the frame of the elevator extendable. 









      To check analog values:

      // the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
          void setup() {
            // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
            Serial.begin(9600);
          }

          // the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
          void loop() {
            // read the input on analog pin 0:
            int sensorValue = analogRead(A4);
            // print out the value you read:
            Serial.println(sensorValue);
            delay(10);        // delay in between reads for stability
          }
