  <p> Hello, my name is Mohammed! </p> 

  <p> I am currently a senior at Harvard College concentrating in human developmental and regenerative biology with a secondary in global health and health policy. Perhaps not so surprisingly, I am passionate about science, research, and medicine. I work as a research assistant in the Myles Brown laboratory at Dana Farber Cancer Institute where I study the effects of obesity on the progression of triple negative breast cancer, and I find the work very interesting. </p>

  <p> Outside of school and research, my favorite hobby is longboarding. My brother and I have always enjoyed longboarding together back home in New Jersey, especially in the summertime. I also enjoy watching anime and have seen most of the movies produced by Studio Ghibli. If you have not heard of Studio Ghibli or seen any of their movies, you’re missing out on some amazing films! And if you have any anime recommendations, I’d love to hear them. </p>
