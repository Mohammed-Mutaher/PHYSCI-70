  ### Week 1: Final Project Proposal  

  <p> I have several ideas for my final project. Potential candidates are a 2-D drawing machine, a device that can stir milk, and a stairlift/elevator for pets. This is the first makerspace that I have stepped foot in, so I am unsure how any of these projects will turn out. The 2-D drawing machine is pretty straightforward. If modified, it could reasonably be used as a latte art machine (which are ridiculously expensive) or to draw on icing for cakes. </p>

  <p> The inspiration for a device that can stir milk came from the time I spent cooking with my mother. Some of the deserts that she makes require boiling milk, which can be a time-consuming process because if you do not stir the consistently, the milk will either burn. Constant supervision is required because the milk can also boil over. The device would be able to stir the bottom of the pot consistently, be adaptable for different sized pots, and perhaps turn off the stove once the boiling temperature of milk is reached. </p>

  <p> Lastly, I thought about making a stairlift/elevator for pets. More specifically, it would be used in cases where the pet is older and cannot climb up and down the stairs easily. This would would be weight-activated, so it would move only when the pet steps onto the platform. The pet should not be able to get off mid-ride, and the lift should be able to go both ways. </p>
