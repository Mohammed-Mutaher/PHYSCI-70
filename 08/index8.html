      Work in progress! I had technical difficulties using the SRM-20. I had to adjust the dimensions in the original Fusion360 design before the program would allow me to move past the "calculate" step. The machine would not start to cut and because of a command error that read "The SRM-20 is paused." </p>

      <p> This week, we focused on CNC Milling, Molding & Casting. </p>
      
      <p> We were instructed to design something and make it using CNC (either the ShopBot, the Shaper, or the SRM-20) and to create something by molding and casting. First, I experimented with both the ShopBot and the SRM-20. Using the SRM-20, I was able to mill a 2.5D mold out of a wax block. I used the wax mold to make a silicon mold, which I cast using plaster (DryStone Casting Media mixed with water). </p>

      <p> First, I experimented with the ShopBot. The month of Ramadan had just started, which inspired me to make this design (click <a href="Ramadan.dxf" download> here</a> to download the.dxf file): </p>

      <img src="./Ramadan.png" width="50%" alt="" class="center">

      <p> I found the crescent moon design online and converted the image from a .png file to an .svg file so that I could import it into Fusion 360. I added the text ("Ramadan Mubarak!") and used the "Explode Text" function to change the plain text into an outline of the letters with space inside to be cut. I exported the design as a .dxf file and loaded the file in Aspire to cut using the Shopbot. I inputted the dimensions of the figure and the thickness (average of several readings) of the OSB material using calipers, and joined the vectors. Then, I clicked on the "Pocket toolpath" icon under the "Toolpaths" tab so I could carve the design and letters into the material as pocket cuts. After using wood screws to hold the OSB in place on top of the sacrifical layer, I was ready to turn on the machine. Ibrahim helped me with using the machine. The 1/8" bit was apparently too large to carve out the design and a smaller bit would take significantly longer to cut, so Ibrahim advised me to leave the 1/8" drill bit in and change the drill bit diameter in Aspire. After decreasing the drill bit diameter in Aspire to 1/20", the program calculated a toolppath. the diameter  inputted the bit diameter as because I was having difficulty getting the machine to cut the material The bit was 3.0mm Ibrahim helped me operate the Shopbot.


      <p> Here is the <a href="Pfp mold.stl" download>.stl file</a> that I was trying to carve out of wax.
